This is a server built with Node.js, Express and MongoDB to serve as a connection between the flutter mobile app (used to the content of my personal website) and my personal website. This server used CRUD requests to edit and get the latest changes from the Database made by the mobile app and reflect those changes on [my personal website](https://abdulbaseetshabi.github.io/personal_website).
