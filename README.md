# resume_backend
This is a server built with Node.js, Express and MongoDB to serve as a connection between the flutter (IOS and Andriod) mobile app (used to the content of my web resume) and the web resume. This server used CRUD requests to edit and get the latest changes from the Database made by the mobile app and reflect those changes on my web resume (https://abdulbaseetshabi.github.io/).
